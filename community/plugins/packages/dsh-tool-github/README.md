# dsh-tool-github

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The **model-facing `github_*` tool suite** over [`dsh-github`](../dsh-github/README.md) (`ctx.github`). This package owns schemas, validation, prompt guidance, tool-layer budgets, and presentation — never providers, transport, or credentials.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `github_search` | Search issues / pull-requests / repositories / code (CLOSED kind union). Lean hits: `owner/repo#N [state] title` + URL. |
| `github_issue_read` | Title, state, labels, body, plus capped aggregated comments. |
| `github_pr_read` | Split into on-demand parts: `metadata` (default) / `diff` / `comments` / `reviews` / `checks` / `ci-failures` — one call never pays for data the model did not ask for. |
| `github_pr_review` | Assemble the structured review task for one PR: diff (once), the dimensions that apply to these changes, each one's checklist, the severity scale, and the finding contract. Evidence and a contract — not a verdict (ADR-0013). |
| `github_pr_list` | List a repository's pull requests, filtered by state and head/base. Read-only. |
| `github_issue_create` | Write, approval-gated. |
| `github_issue_comment` | Write, approval-gated. |
| `github_pr_create` | Write, approval-gated, idempotent (an already-open PR for the same head/base is a normal answer, not an error). |
| `github_pr_review_submit` | Write, approval-gated. Submits a review with inline comments. `APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES` exist only when `reviewVerdicts` is on (ADR-0014). |
| `github_pr_update` | Write, approval-gated. Title, body, base branch, open/closed. |
| `github_pr_assign` | Write, approval-gated. Request reviewers, apply labels. |

## Configuration

| Field | Default | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `write` | `true` | Register the three write tools. Off = they are absent from the tool catalog entirely. |
| `searchMaxResults` | `8` | Cap on hits per search (search API rate budget is scarce: 30 req/min). |
| `maxComments` | `30` | Cap on returned conversation comments per read. |
| `diffMaxFiles` / `diffMaxPatchChars` | `50` / `60000` | **Tool-owned** diff budgets (ADR-0005): held here, passed to the seam, enforced there. |
| `logMaxLines` / `logMaxChars` | `80` / `8000` | **Tool-owned** CI log budgets, same mechanism. Only ever applied to a log TAIL (ADR-0015). |
| `reviewMaxFiles` / `reviewMaxPatchChars` | `60` / `120000` | **Tool-owned** review-brief budgets. Deliberately their own numbers, not the diff budgets above: a review reads wider than a plain diff read (ADR-0013). |
| `reviewVerdicts` | `false` | Whether `APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES` exist at all. Off by default (ADR-0014) — see below. |
| `timeoutMs` | `30000` | Cooperative timeout attached to every tool (`dsh-timeout-policy` enforces). |

## Review verdicts are off by default (ADR-0014)

Submitting a review is this package's first operation with a **social** consequence: `APPROVE` and `REQUEST_CHANGES` go out under the user's own account, read to collaborators as their judgement, and change whether the PR is blocked. Approval-per-call is the wrong last line of defence for that — under approval fatigue, one distracted "yes" is all it takes.

So the capability itself is opt-in. With `reviewVerdicts` off (the default), the event enum contains only `COMMENT`: the model never sees that approving is possible, so it cannot attempt it and be refused. Turning the switch on widens the enum, and each submission still passes the approval waterfall with a reason that names the event and its consequence.

Two things worth knowing:

- GitHub refuses `APPROVE` and `REQUEST_CHANGES` on **your own** pull request. The status bar's [AI review] path is exactly that case, so it can only ever produce `COMMENT` — the provider translates the platform's terse 422 into a sentence saying so.
- The host's `PreToolDecision` carries only a reason string, with no risk level to raise, so the wording of that reason *is* the whole confirmation layer available here. See the M10 implementation note in the execution plan.

## Approval flow (writes)

Every write returns `ask` from `tools/pre-execute` with a human-readable reason naming the target repo, title, and a body preview — exactly what the host's ApprovalPanel renders. The registry resolves the ask through the optional approval seam: `allowed-once` proceeds; rejection, cancellation, and an absent approval channel each materialize a distinct model-visible refusal result (never an exception), so the model can explain and continue. Read tools pass the gate untouched.

## Presentation

`presentCall` / `presentResult` are pure and replay-safe: reads render as `read`/`search` cards, writes as `edit` cards; `github_pr_create` presents `created: false` as "PR #N already open". Result meta is narrowed defensively — malformed replay meta falls back to the generic card instead of throwing.

## Errors the model can act on

Seam failures are translated at the tool boundary: rate limits become a wait-and-retry hint carrying `retryAfterMs` (and a nudge toward direct reads over search), auth failures name the fix (connect GitHub / set `GITHUB_TOKEN`), not-found points at the handle. Diff truncation is surfaced with a "narrow the scope" hint.

## Model Experience

The model sees six tools with strict, small schemas; portable `owner/repo` + `number` handles that flow between search hits and reads; lean text renderings tuned for token spend; honest truncation markers with recovery hints; and write refusals phrased as answers. The system prompt section teaches the part-split PR read and the approval semantics up front.

`github_pr_review` is the one tool that hands the model a **task shape** rather than data. Asked to "review this PR", a model left to itself reads the diff and improvises: coverage varies run to run, severity is ad hoc, and findings arrive without a line to point at. The tool replaces that with a brief whose dimensions were **routed deterministically from the change itself** — a docs-only PR is never asked about type design — each carrying a checklist, plus one fixed severity vocabulary and a contract every finding must meet. It ships no verdict and no score: the coverage and the shape are guaranteed, the judgement stays the model's (ADR-0013).

Two parts exist so the model can close a loop rather than merely observe one. `part=reviews` returns the verdicts AND the line-anchored comments — rendered as `path:line · author (side): body`, which is directly actionable, unlike an issue-level comment thread. A comment whose line is gone (outdated) carries its diff hunk instead, because that is the only anchor left. `part=ci-failures` answers *why* a check failed: structured annotations when the CI tool reported them, otherwise a budgeted log **tail** — never a head, since failures surface at the end. When neither exists the model is told so plainly instead of being handed an empty block.
